# 13. Candy Store

This is a good opportunity to introduce another new blueprint. This time we've
created a candy store with two products, candy tokens and chocolate egg
non-fungibles that each have toys inside. We also have not just an owner role,
but manager and staff roles too, so the store owner doesn't have to run all the
day to day of the store. This introduces the new concept of **authorization
roles**.

## Using the Candy Store

### Setup

1.  First, clone the repository if you have not done so, and then change
    directory to this example.

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/radixdlt/official-examples.git

    cd official-examples/step-by-step/12-candy-store
    ```

2.  There is a startup script that will reset `resim`, publish the `CandyStore`
    package and create environmental variables of useful values for you. To run
    it, **make sure you're in the right directory** and use the following
    command:

    on Linux or MacOS:

    ```sh
    source ./startup.sh
    ```

    on Windows:

    ```dos
    .\startup.bat
    ```

    Alternatively, you can run the commands in the script manually.

    1. Reset the simulator, create a new account and export the account address.

       ```sh
       resim reset
       resim new-account
       ```

       ```sh
       export account=<ACCOUNT_ADDRESS>
       ```

    2. Then, publish the package and export the package address.

       ```sh
       resim publish .
       ```

       ```sh
       export package=<PACKAGE_ADDRESS>
       ```

3.  Use the package address (or
    `resim run manifests/instantiate_candy_store.rtm`) to instantiate the candy
    store, choosing a price for the candy and chocolate bars.

    ```sh
    resim call-function <PACKAGE_ADDRESS> CandyStore instantiate_candy_store <CANDY_PRICE> <CHOCOLATE_BAR_PRICE>
    ```

    and export the component address.

    ```sh
    export component=<COMPONENT_ADDRESS>
    ```

    An owner badge, an manager badge and 5 staff badges are created
    automatically when the candy store is instantiated. The badges will be in
    your account.

4.  Inspect your account looking at the `Owned Fungible Resources` section to
    see the badges and export their addresses.

    ```
    resim show <ACCOUNT_ADDRESS>
    ```

    ```sh
    export owner_badge=<OWNER_BADGE_ADDRESS>
    export manager_badge=<MANAGER_BADGE_ADDRESS>
    export staff_badge=<STAFF_BADGE_ADDRESS>
    ```

### Usage

The new methods here work similarly to the gumball machine examples. Try them
out in whichever order you like.

Remember that;

- you can view any component, resource or account with `resim show <ADDRESS>`,
- the XRD address in resim is
  `resource_sim1tknxxxxxxxxxradxrdxxxxxxxxx009923554798xxxxxxxxxakj8n3` and can
  be seen in your account,
- to present a proof you need to use the `--proofs` flag and specify the
  quantity of each resource you want to use as proof. e.g.
  `resim call-method <COMPONENT_ADDRESS> restock_store --proof <STAFF_BADGE_ADDRESS>:1`,
- if you want to see the transaction manifest that's generated under the hood,
  add the `--manifest` flag, followed by the name of the file you want to save.
  e.g.
  `resim call-method <COMPONENT_ADDRESS> mint_staff_badge --proof <MANAGER_BADGE_ADDRESS>:1 --manifest manifest.rtm`,
- example transaction manifests that use the exported variables from setup can
  be found in the `manifests` directory,
- once you have some transaction manifests, you can try deploying the package on
  Stokenet via the
  [Console](https://stokenet-console.radixdlt.com/deploy-package), then use the
  manifests to run the methods of the deployed component.
